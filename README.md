Welcome to the Dream Tasker. 

Origin: This was a personal idea for practice, then a school project, and back to personal project. 

The Goal: The goal with this project is for it to become a swiss army knife of sorts in the realm of task managment. With a calendar for organizing events (using calendar.js), lists for marking down task and goals, budgeting/
financial support with the inclusion of charts (most likely using chart.js), and as much more as can be crammed in. 

Where It's At: Currently the project is not finished, but there are working aspects, enough to get the idea of what's envisioned to be seen. The entire aspect of a financial web app is entirely missing. I'd like to get down
features like the calendar and list in more ideal conditions. 

To Be Done: Thematically, figure out the art direction (colors, style) that fit this app and make it unique. Work on calendar feature/get comfortable with calendar.js, complete list feature with option to check list items 
and edit list, and begin work on financial aspects of the app.
